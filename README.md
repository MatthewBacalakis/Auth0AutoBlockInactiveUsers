# Automatically Blocking Inactive Users In Auth0

Sample implementation of an offline process that uses the Auth0 management api to identify and then block users who haven't logged in in a certain number of days. **This is a proof of concept and should not be considered production ready code.**

# Prerequisites

- Written in C# this POC requires you have the [.Net Core Runtime or SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/dependencies?tabs=netcore30&pivots=os-macos) installed.

- You must define a M2M application in Auth0 to represent this process. The process will use this application's client_id and client_secret to fetch access tokens to call the Auth0 Management Api. The application must be authorized for the Management Api with the read:users and update:users scopes.

# Configuration

The appsettings.json file must be populated with the appropriate values before running.

| RateLimitThrottle | Calls to the Auth0 Management api are [rate limited](https://auth0.com/docs/policies/rate-limits). This setting restricts how much of your tenant's alloted calls the process can consume. For a production tenant a setting of 25 will ensure this process pauses when more then 50% of your tenant's alloted requests per second are consumed. The process will resume after a delay to allow the requests to replenish. Setting the value to 0 will result in the process consuming the maximum possible requests per second. |

# Running the POC

This POC can be run from the terminal with the `dotnet run` command. To aid testing running `dotnet run -u` will unblock users one page of users. The number of uses unblocked will be the value of the UserPageSize setting.
